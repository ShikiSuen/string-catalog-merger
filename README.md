# XcStringMerger

Allow merging the translated [String Catalog](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog) with the project's current String Catalog, useful for resolving merge conflicts.

## Features

- Save your WIP merge session in the file.
- Localized in Chinese (Traditional).

## Components

- `XcStringMerger`: The core of the merger, with the type declaration of String Catalog included.
